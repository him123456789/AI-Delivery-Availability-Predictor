# AI-Powered Delivery Availability Prediction System

## 🎯 Overview

This project implements an advanced AI model that predicts customer availability for deliveries based on historical records and calendar data. The system can recommend optimal delivery time windows to maximize successful delivery rates and improve customer satisfaction.

## 🚀 Features

- **Customer Availability Prediction**: Predicts the probability of a customer being home at specific times
- **Optimal Time Window Recommendation**: Suggests the best delivery times for each customer
- **Calendar Integration**: Considers customer calendar events and conflicts
- **Multiple Customer Profiles**: Handles different customer types (working professionals, retirees, students, etc.)
- **Historical Learning**: Uses past delivery attempts to improve predictions
- **Weather Impact Analysis**: Factors in weather conditions affecting availability
- **Business Insights**: Provides actionable insights for delivery optimization

## 📊 Dataset

The system uses three main datasets:

### 1. Customer Profiles (`customers.csv`)
- Customer demographics and characteristics
- Profile types: working_professional, stay_at_home, student, retiree, shift_worker
- Location, age, household size, pets, work-from-home status

### 2. Delivery History (`delivery_history.csv`)
- Historical delivery attempts and outcomes
- Time windows, success rates, weather conditions
- Calendar conflicts and special circumstances
- Over 100,000+ historical delivery records

### 3. Calendar Data (`calendar_data.csv`)
- Customer calendar events and schedules
- Event types, priorities, and time conflicts
- Recurring events and availability patterns

## 🤖 AI Model

The system uses ensemble machine learning techniques:

- **Random Forest Classifier**: For robust feature importance analysis
- **Gradient Boosting**: For high-accuracy predictions
- **Logistic Regression**: For interpretable probability estimates

### Key Features Used:
- Customer demographics and profile type
- Time-based features (day of week, time period, season)
- Calendar conflicts and event types
- Historical success patterns
- Weather conditions
- Package characteristics

## 🚀 Deploy

- Streamlit Community Cloud: follow `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Latest Release Notes: see [v1.0.0 Release](https://github.com/him123456789/AI-Delivery-Availability-Predictor/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd delivery-availability-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate dataset** (if needed):
   ```bash
   python generate_dataset.py
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start Demo
```bash
python demo.py
```

### Using the Model Programmatically

```python
from delivery_availability_model import DeliveryAvailabilityPredictor
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize and load trained model
predictor = DeliveryAvailabilityPredictor()
predictor.load_model('delivery_availability_model.pkl')

# Example customer data
customer_data = {
    'customer_id': 123,
    'profile_type': 'working_professional',
    'age': 32,
    'location_type': 'urban',
    'household_size': 2,
    'has_pets': True,
    'work_from_home': False
}

# Predict availability for tomorrow at 2-5 PM
target_date = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)
prediction = predictor.predict_availability(
    customer_data, 
    target_date, 
    ('14:00', '17:00')
)

print(f"Availability probability: {prediction['availability_probability']:.1%}")
print(f"Likely available: {prediction['is_likely_available']}")

# Find optimal delivery time
optimal_time = predictor.find_optimal_delivery_time(customer_data, target_date)
print(f"Best time: {optimal_time['recommendation']}")
```

## ☁️ Live Weather Integration

This app supports live weather to improve prediction accuracy. It uses OpenWeather (primary) and WeatherAPI (fallback). The live condition is mapped to the app's categories: `sunny`, `cloudy`, `rainy`, `snowy`.

### Add Secrets

Create Streamlit secrets with at least one provider key:

```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "your_openweather_key"
WEATHERAPI_KEY = "your_weatherapi_key"

# Optional: cache TTL (seconds, default 600)
WEATHER_CACHE_TTL = 600
```

- Streamlit Cloud: App → Settings → Secrets → paste the TOML above
- Local development: create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (do NOT commit)

An example file is included at `secrets_example.toml` (copy its contents into Secrets).

### Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

On the "Prediction Tool" page, enable "Use live weather" and choose City or Coordinates. If secrets are set, the app shows live condition, mapped category, and temperature used in predictions.

### Configuring Streamlit (optional)

You can create `.streamlit/config.toml` with recommended settings. An example is provided in `streamlit_config_example.toml`:

```toml
[server]
headless = true
enableCORS = true
enableXsrfProtection = true

[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false

[theme]
base = "light"
primaryColor = "#1f77b4"
font = "sans serif"
```

## 📈 Model Performance

The AI model achieves:
- **Accuracy**: ~85-90% on test data
- **AUC Score**: ~0.88-0.92
- **Precision**: High precision for positive predictions
- **Recall**: Balanced recall across different customer types

## 🎯 Business Impact

### Key Insights:
- **Evening deliveries** (6-9 PM) have the highest success rates
- **Weekend deliveries** show 15-20% higher success rates
- **Calendar conflicts** reduce availability by 25-30%
- **Weather conditions** impact availability by 5-15%

### Recommendations:
1. **Prioritize evening time slots** for working professionals
2. **Use weekend delivery options** when possible
3. **Integrate calendar systems** to avoid conflicts
4. **Adjust schedules** based on weather forecasts
5. **Implement customer preference learning** for repeat customers

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Customer Profiles
Modify the `customer_profiles` dictionary in `generate_dataset.py`:

```python
'new_profile': {
    'home_weekday_morning': 0.3,
    'home_weekday_afternoon': 0.2,
    'home_weekday_evening': 0.8,
    'home_weekend': 0.9,
    'calendar_busy_prob': 0.4
}
```

### Extending Time Windows
Add new time periods in the `time_windows` list:

```python
('22:00', '24:00', 'late_night')
```

### Adding New Features
Extend the feature engineering in `_engineer_features()` method:

```python
# Example: Add distance-based features
df['delivery_distance'] = calculate_distance(df['customer_location'])
```

## 📊 Visualization and Analytics

The system provides comprehensive analytics:
- Success rates by time period and customer type
- Calendar conflict impact analysis
- Weather and seasonal patterns
- Customer behavior insights
- Delivery optimization recommendations
